Problem Statememnt ---> Customer churn is a significant issue for banks, impacting revenue and customer lifetime value. The goal is to develop a machine learning model

we will not handle the outliers in this data the reason is this is bank data and many users whose age is more than 80 then high chance that they will churn.
